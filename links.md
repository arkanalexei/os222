## Week 1

1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
A great introduction to OS in general, animated and entertaining. Breaks down difficult concepts piece by piece so it is less difficult to comprehend.<br>

2. [The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE)<br>
Your typical TED Talk. While not academically helpful, it still provided me with great insights from the man who created Linux.
Truly a visionary. Impacted billions of people worldwide but perhaps received less recognition than he should have.<br>

3. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)<br>
An essential for OS course. Learning markdown is perhaps just as important as learning git.<br>

## Week 2
1. [Asymmetric Encryption - Simply explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDCe585Lnc)<br>
A brief overview on asymmetric encription.
I think it's relevant to this week's topic. Which is why I included it.<br>

2. [How secure is 256 bit security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY)<br>
Excellent explanation and animation by 3Blue1Brown regarding cryptography. It gives you an idea of just how secure 2^256 is. Or maybe, we still don't understand just HOW secure it is.

## Week 3
1. [File System Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-system.htm)<br>
Everything you need to know regarding file systems in Unix/Linux. Comprehensive as well. With examples provided<br>

2. [Linux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)<br>
Exactly as the title suggests. Great for those who are on the go or busy!<br>

## Week 4
1. [you will never ask about pointers again after watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM)<br>
This video is actually pretty helpful in helping me understand pointers. It's witty and relatable(?). But often I refer to this video when I need a refresher on pointers.<br>

2. [Logical vs Physical address space | OS | Lec-32 | Bhanu Priya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDs53dBjErA)<br>
Basically a 7.5 minute lecture. Helped me understand the topic a little better, though!<br>
