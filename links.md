## Week 1

1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<<br>
A great introduction to OS in general, animated and entertaining. Breaks down difficult concepts piece by piece so it is less difficult to comprehend.<br>

2. [The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE)<br>
Your typical TED Talk. While not academically helpful, it still provided me with great insights from the man who created Linux.
Truly a visionary. Impacted billions of people worldwide but perhaps received less recognition than he should have.<br>

3. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)<br>
An essential for OS course. Learning markdown is perhaps just as important as learning git.<br>

## Week 2
1. [Asymmetric Encryption - Simply explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDCe585Lnc)<br>
A brief overview on asymmetric encription.
I think it's relevant to this week's topic. Which is why I included it.<br>

2. [How secure is 256 bit security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY)<br>
Excellent explanation and animation by 3Blue1Brown regarding cryptography. It gives you an idea of just how secure 2^256 is. Or maybe, we still don't understand just HOW secure it is.
