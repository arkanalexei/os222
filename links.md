## Week 1

1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
A great introduction to OS in general, animated and entertaining. Breaks down difficult concepts piece by piece so it is less difficult to comprehend.<br>

2. [The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE)<br>
Your typical TED Talk. While not academically helpful, it still provided me with great insights from the man who created Linux.
Truly a visionary. Impacted billions of people worldwide but perhaps received less recognition than he should have.<br>

3. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)<br>
An essential for OS course. Learning markdown is perhaps just as important as learning git.<br>

## Week 2
1. [Asymmetric Encryption - Simply explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDCe585Lnc)<br>
A brief overview on asymmetric encription.
I think it's relevant to this week's topic. Which is why I included it.<br>

2. [How secure is 256 bit security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY)<br>
Excellent explanation and animation by 3Blue1Brown regarding cryptography. It gives you an idea of just how secure 2^256 is. Or maybe, we still don't understand just HOW secure it is.

## Week 3
1. [File System Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-system.htm)<br>
Everything you need to know regarding file systems in Unix/Linux. Comprehensive as well. With examples provided<br>

2. [Linux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)<br>
Exactly as the title suggests. Great for those who are on the go or busy!<br>

## Week 4
1. [you will never ask about pointers again after watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM)<br>
This video is actually pretty helpful in helping me understand pointers. It's witty and relatable(?). But often I refer to this video when I need a refresher on pointers.<br>

2. [Logical vs Physical address space | OS | Lec-32 | Bhanu Priya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDs53dBjErA)<br>
Basically a 7.5 minute lecture. Helped me understand the topic a little better, though!<br>

## Week 5
1. [What's Virtual Memory?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lFnKYCZT5o)<br>
Taken from the famous YouTube channel Computerphile (from the guys who made Numberphile). Great stuff in general.<br>

2. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Explanation by GeeksforGeeks. I recommend this website due to its in-depth explanation.<br>

## Week 6
1. [Processes and Threads (Concurrency Basics)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv7mzX8w3jI)<br>
A short yet informative video on this week's topic. Only ~5 minutes long. Highly recommend you to watch!<br>

2. [Threads and Concurrency](https://applied-programming.github.io/Operating-Systems-Notes/3-Threads-and-Concurrency/)<br>
Prefer to read instead? Enjoy this article that someone else on the internet have compiled for you. Happy reading! <br>

## Week 7
1. [Process Synchronization Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph2awKa8r5Y&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjDf_dmCEXgl6XjVKDDj0M2)<br>
This channel has saved my grades multiple times in the past. I trust in these guys on my OS grade as well. üôèüôè<br>

2. [Regarding Deadlocks](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/7_Deadlocks.html)<br>
A short yet concise summary of deadlocks courtesy of the University of Illinois Chicago. Interesting!<br>

## Week 8 
1. [Process Scheduling in Linux](https://medium.com/geekculture/process-scheduling-in-linux-592028a5d545)<br>
A Medium article on Scheduling. Also includes a cute doggo pic. <br>

2. [expat-2.4.8.tar.xz](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/releases/tag/R_2_4_8)<br>
If you are following this week's instructions, chances are you will see that expat.2.4.8.tar.xz is not available to download. To counter this, I've provided you a mirror link to get it since the original link is broken.<br>

3. [zlib-1.2.12.tar.xz](https://distfiles.macports.org/zlib/)<br>
Same issue with expat. Here I've provided a link for the zlib library. Enjoy!<br>

4. [Process Scheduling Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h3eWaPx8SA)<br>
Same concept as the Medium link. But now in video! Courtesy of Neso Academy on YouTube.

## Week 9
1. [Understanding and Using Systemd](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/understanding-and-using-systemd/)<br>
I love this explanation of Systemd. Written by Carla Schroder of Linux.com

2. [Why Linux Torvalds doesn't use Ubuntu or Debian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHGTs1NSB1s)<br>
Why doesn't he use Ubuntu or Debian? Nobody knows! Watch this video to find out!!

## Week 10
Does anyone actually reads this? Well, I assume no so for Week 10 I'll provide some of my favorite video essays instead.<br>
1. [The man who tried to fake an element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5WT22-AO8)<br>
Amazing visualization and story telling. Highly recommend.<br>

2. [The Dark Side Of The Silk Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpMP6Nh3FvU)<br>
Silk Road is perhaps the most popular website on the dark web. This video encompasses the founder's (Ross Ulbricht) journey on developing the site.<br>

3. [Disney's FastPass: A Complicated History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yjZpBq1XBE)<br>
You'll notice that all of the videos I've provided are over 1 hour long. Welp, I guess I like my videos long and slow-paced ;)<br>
