# TIPS

## Be Precise
I believe that the OS course is precise and methodical. Hence, you must pay extra attention to every single detail as instructed by Mr. RMS and TAs.

## Do NOT Procrastinate
OS has a strict deadline of exactly 1 week for each task. Use this time wisely and do your assignments as early as you can to prevent errors or recklessness.

## Frequently Log Your Activities
Trust me, it adds up!

## Check SCeLE Often
Be prepared by checking the forums often. Or pray that you are not in ATTN :)

## Find another Hugo in your class
Can't stress how much this dude helped with my OS course from tutorials to troubleshooting. So, be kind to your peers and your peers will help you ^__^

Don't forget to be respectful though! Thank you Sir Hugo !!
